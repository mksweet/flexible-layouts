This 5 row layout is coined 'flexible' because panes in rows 2 and 4 are allowed to flow from one area to another in the same row. For example, take row 2:

If all spots in row 2 are occupied:
Row 1: [       X       ]
Row 2: [ X ] [ X ] [ X ]
Row 3: [       X       ]
Row 4: [ X ] [ X ] [ X ]
Row 5: [       X       ]

If only the left area of row 2 is occupied, it will flow across the entire row:
Row 1: [       X       ]
Row 2: [       X       ]
Row 3: [       X       ]
Row 4: [ X ] [ X ] [ X ]
Row 5: [       X       ]

If the center area of row 2 is unoccupied, left will flow into that area:
Row 1: [       X       ]
Row 2: [    X    ] [ X ]
Row 3: [       X       ]
Row 4: [ X ] [ X ] [ X ]
Row 5: [       X       ]

If the right area of row 2 is unoccupied, center will flow into that area:
Row 1: [       X       ]
Row 2: [ X ] [     X   ]
Row 3: [       X       ]
Row 4: [ X ] [ X ] [ X ]
Row 5: [       X       ]
